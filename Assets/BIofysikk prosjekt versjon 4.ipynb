We will also visualize the process to showcase different phenomenon, such as how monomers might consolidate into huge clusters and how polymers might adept their shape to best fit their enviromet.

Thus, the first step will take meassures before and after, $E_0$ and $E_n$, to verify that the energy level of the successive system has declined. If the process succeeds, the move will be initiated. Although we want a converging system we will occasionally allow a \"deviation\". If a move failes the first step there will be a slim chance for the move to occur.

    "The first algorithem, createSystemOfMonomers(N, M) takes two arguments: N and M. These represent a given grid size and the amount of monomers in the system, respectively.\n",

Furthermore it creates an array containing all of the possible values of the monomers in the system i.e. [-M, -M+1, ..., 0, ..., M-1, M]. Since the solvent is given the value 0, numpy.delete() is used to remove 0 from the array containg the distinct values of the monomers. The sign of each of the values represent the electrostatic charge of each of the given monomers.\n",

The random.randint() built in function is used to generate random pairs of coordinates which is to be considered for the placement of a monomer. If such a pair of coordinates is allready occupied by a monomer, the if statement inside the while loop assures the generation of another such pair until a legal placement is obtained.\n",

    "The third function, plotSystems(grids, info, title), is the plotting function. It takes inn a list of grids, a 2d list of informantion and values for each grid, and the title for all plots. Firstly the functions initializes the number of grids to plot and the distance between each grid points for monomers. Secondly we create the title for each subplot; we add the subplot tile together with the value of $N$. From the 2d info list we get the values for $N_s$, $M$, $T$ and $L$. We add these to the subplot title if they are nonzero.\n",
    "Furthermore we create subplots for each grid by using plt.subplots(). When only creating one subplot, axs will be a single element and not a list. Therefore we need an exception when only plotting one grid, and making axs a list. Using figsize, subplots_adjust and suptitle we adjust the sizes and distanses between the subplots and add a title for the whole figure.\n",
    "For the plotting, we first set the solvent the same color as the example provided and we iterate through all grids from the grids list. There are three different ways to color the systems, either a clustered grid with distinct positive values, a polymer system with $M$ positive and $M$ negative polymers with shades of green and purple, or simple monomers with positive or negative charges, thus green and purple color.\n",

Lastly we add the title for each subplot containing information for this plot aswell as the unit of measurement $a$.\n",
