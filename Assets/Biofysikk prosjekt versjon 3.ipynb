    "In this project we will utilize several numerical tools to study formations of membrane-less organells. We will be using some simple Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate how systemes of monomers and polymers will gradually develope over time. Our MC simulations will be following some basic physical principle to ensure a realistic model. We will also visualize the process to showcase different phenomenon, such as how monomers might consolidate into huge clusters and how polymers might adept their shape to best fit their enviromet. Thourghout the project we will also observe how energy will evolve and eventually oscillate around a equilibrium."

    "In our system we will simplify a plane to a 2-dimensional grid, meaning positions will be quantified. In these discrete system our meassure of distance and interaction inbetween monomers will also be simplified. If monomers are not neighbouring, they won't effect eachother. Even though there will be some kind of electrical force pulling and pushing monomers around, we will neglact this behavior. Moreover, our grid will be a relaitvly small representation of the entire cell. To ensure some realistic behavior \"outside\" the grid, we will assume the grid periodic. In practice this means our grid takes place on a geometric torus, looping around in all directions. Our unit step length will be $a = (23 \\cdot 10^{-6})^2 m$ and $a = (91 \\cdot 10^{-6})^2 m$ in the monomer and polymer case respectivly. The relativ permativity will be $\\varepsilon_r = 78$ for both cases\n",

    "To illustarte our system, we will be using the Metropolis algorithm. First we need to attempt a legal move. The law of conservation of energy will ensure that the system energy will diminish or stabilize. Thus, the first step will take meassures before and after, $E_0$ and $E_n$, to verify that the energy level of the successive system has declined. If the process succeeds, the move will be initiated. \n",

Trying to write an efficient enough code proved quite hard. Our Monte Carlo simulation was not compatible  with a million iterations. Thus we tried to reach a higher potensial for the code. We have imported Numba JiT to decrease run time. The majority of the functions, escpacially those with longer chains of for-loop, have been JiTed. \n",

Jit are very comfortable with the standard library and parts of the numpy library. On a rare occasions some external functions were implemented, but the mindset of the function are very basic. One can say that the code is \"better\" since it runs faster, but elementary principles in coding theory are not followed. We have prioritized runtime over code quality for this project. "

    "The first algorithem, createSystemOfMonomers(N, M) takes two arguments: $N$ and $M$. These represent a given grid size and the amount of monomers, respectively.\n",
    "The initilazation of an empty NxN grid is done by numpy.zeros([N,N]). Which creates an $N\\times N$ grid with all zeros. Furthermore it creates an array containing all of the possible values of the monomers in the system i.e. [-M, -M+1, ..., 0, ..., M-1, M]. Since the solvent is given the value 0, numpy.delete() is used to remove 0 from the array containg the distinct values of the monomers. The sign of each of the values represent the electrostatic charge of each of the given monomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a random grid of monomers the algorithm implements the numpy.random.shuffle() to make sure the distinct values will be placed arbitrary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of a while loop in conjuction with an if statement is done to assure no monomer is placed upon another. The random.randint() built in function is used to generate random pairs of coordinates which is to be considered for the placement of a monomer. If such a pair of coordinates is allready occupied by a monomer, the if statement inside the while loop assures the generation of another such pair until a legal placement is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "When all of the monomers is placed in the grid, the function numpy.argwhere() returns an array containing the specific coordinates for the monomers in the grid. This array is sorted along the first axis.\n",

    "The second algorithm, checkMonomers(grid, M), utilizes argwhere() to gather data on monomer positions. By checking the size of the returning array, the function can know how many monomers are placed. The functions confirmes or declines that the grid indeed contains $2M$ monomers, by printing an appropriate string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The third function, plotSystems(grids, info, title), is the plotting function. It takes in a list of grids, a 2d list of informantion and values for each grid, and the title for all plots. Firstly the functions initializes the number of grids to plot and the distance between each grid points for monomers. Secondly we create the title for each subplot; we add the subplot tile together with the value of $N$. From the 2d info list we get the values for $N_s$, $M$, $T$ and $L$. We add these to the subplot title if they are nonzero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore the function create subplots for each grid by using plt.subplots(). When only creating one subplot, axs will be a single element and not a list. Therefore an exception is needed when plotting a single grid. Using figsize, subplots_adjust and suptitle we adjust the sizes and distanses between the subplots and add a title for the whole figure.\n",

    "To be consistent with the example provided, the solvent is set to always be \"Paleturquoise\" There are three different ways to color the systems, either a clustered grid with distinct positive values, a polymer system with $M$ positive and $M$ negative polymers with shades of green and purple, or simple monomers with positive or negative charges, thus green and purple color. By altering the last arguments in \"info\" one can adjust the colors to best fit the system.\n",

    "Inspection of the energy plot instantly gives that the energy of system of monomers decrease when temperature falls. The final plots displays why it is the case. For lower temperature, monomers prefers to group together with their opposite charge. Green monomers want purple neighbours, making a chess board grid. For the higher temperture the grouping phenomenon still happens, but not as frequent .\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a direct consequence of the metropolis algorithm. In a scalding enviroment monomers are more exposed to thermal fluxuation. In our model, the probability of a monomer moving to a higher energy state is given by $P(A)=e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}}$ (If it didn't move to a lower state). Larger values of $T$ makes a total energy increase more likely. Moreover, in a freezing enviroment an increase in total energy is quite rare. We expect that higher temperatures will fluxuate around a higher energy level, which is illustrated in our plots.\n",

The chances to increase system energy are slim whilst temperature is meager, thus the system may get stuck in a local minimum. To circumvent such behaviors, a lucky sequence of fluxuation may be neccessary to proceed. However, such chains are few and far between, indicating an enormous amount of iterations required to acchive equilibrium.\n",

Already $6000$ iterations in the energy occilates. \n",

The only modification done to the energy function is an additional requirement in the if statement. The extra requirement is to make sure there is no interaction between monomers belonging to the same polymer. This is done by using the numpay.not_equal() function, which takes two arrays and returns True if they are not the same. In the above case the function is done to check whether or not the values of the neighbouring monomer is different or not. If they are different the numpay.not_equal() returns True and the energy is affected per usual. \n",

From here the function runs through each of the new locations the polymer is occupying and checks whether or not any of these positions is already occupied by a monomer of a different polymer.

    "isBroken(grid, N, k) takes three inputs, the grid in whcih the movement is happening, the grid size N and the polymer of interest, k. In the same manner as the function rigidMove() this function starts off by initiating an empty grid of size NxN and creates an array containg the locations of the monomers in the system. Furthermore the function moves every location in the grid which is occupied by a monomer in polymer k to the isolated grid. All of these monomers is assigned a unique positive integer. From here the function cluster is used to return the amount of clusters there is in the isolated grid. If the amount of clusters are more than one the funstion returns True, since the polymer is broken. If the amount of clusters equal one, the function returns False.\n",

By iterating through the grid, it deletes the polymer from the new grid while putting them int an isolated grid, where every other entry is $0$. By Numba restrictions, np.roll can only roll 1D-arrays sideways, making the function transpose the matrix for up and down movement. Then iterating though every row/column then every monomer, the function checks if the \"next square\" is occupied or not. If any monomer fail, the entire for-lopo for the row/column breaks before starting a new line. Lastly, by isBroken(), it checks if the move is allowed or not, returning the initial grid. If a move suceeds, the function adds the isolated grid with the new grid and return the updated posistions. "
