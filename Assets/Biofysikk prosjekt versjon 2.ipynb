    "In this project we will utilize several numerical tools to study formations of membrane-less organells. We will be using some simple Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate how systemes of monomers and polymers will gradually develope over time. Our MC simulations will be following some basic physical principle to ensure a realistic model. We will also visualize the process to showcase different phenomenon, such as how monomers might consolidate into huge clusters and how polymers might adept their shape to best fit their enviromet. Thourghout the project we will also observe how energy will evolve and eventually oscillate around a equilibrium."

In these discrete system our meassure of distance and interaction inbetween monomers will also be simplified. If monomers are not neighbouring, they won't effect eachother. Even though there will be some kind of electrical force pulling and pushing monomers around, we will neglact this behavior. Moreover, our grid will be a relaitvly small representation of the entire cell. To ensure some realistic behavior \"outside\" the grid, we will assume the grid periodic. In practice this means our grid takes place on a geometric torus, looping around in all directions.

    "Inspection of the energy plot instantly gives that the energy of system of monomers decrease when temperature falls. The final plots displays why it is the case. For lower temperature, monomers prefers to group together with their opposite charge. Green monomers want purple neighbours, making a chess board grid. For the higher temperture the grouping phenomenon still happens, but not as frequent nor big.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a direct consequence of the metropolis algorithm. In a scalding enviroment monomers are more exposed to thermal fluxuation. In our model, the probability of a monomer moving to a higher energy state is given by $P(A)=e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}}$ (If it didn't move to a lower state). Larger values of $T$ makes an total energy increase more likely. Moreover, in a freezing enviroment a increase in total energy is quite rare. We expect that higher temperatures will fluxuate around a higher energy level, which is illustrated in our plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also observe that $t_{equil}$ is massive for small temperatures. An explaination might be that system with low temperatures are bearly active. The chances to increase system energy are slim whilst temperature is meager, thus the system may get stuck in a local minimum. To circumvent such behaviors, a lucky sequence of fluxuation may be neccessary to proceed. However, such chains are few and far between, indicating an enormous amount of iterations required to acchive equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important remark is how energy for higher temperatures showcases more frenzy, supporting the fact that such systems are highly active. Even though the energy occilates around a mean, its \"amplitide\" is quick large. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our plot, the energy for the system of monomers in the freezing enviroment has a decreasing trend all the way, indicating that it yet has to reach its equilibrium. This supports our theory that lower temperatures need alot of iterations. In the scalding enviroment the energy seems to start to fluxuate around a stable value quickly. Already $6000$ iterations in the energy occilates. \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible explaination is a combination of the high equilibrium energy and that higher temperature have an larger \"interval of equilibrium\". In some sense the initial grid start within the equilibrium range. Thus needing few moves to reach it. "
